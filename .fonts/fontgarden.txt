I create fonts from handwritings. If you want one as well just visit www.fontgarden.org/fontshop for more information. There you can purchase other handwriting fonts as well!

The fonts released are fonts I have converted from handwritings from
people who kindly will let you use their fonts for free.

If you want to redistribute these fonts (for free not for sale!!), it's fine with me,just keep this textfile with the font. These fonts may not be used commercially in anyway. Not to be placed on cd for sale etc... To donate for commercial use go to: www.fontgarden.com/gallery/gallery.htm and click the PayPal donate button. Thanks for being honest!

For one of the net's largest fontarchives and font of the day
